# Lane Detection Configuration - Urban Scenario
# ===============================================
# Optimized for urban/city driving conditions:
# - More noise from surrounding objects (cars, pedestrians, signs)
# - Shorter lane segments due to intersections
# - Possibly worn or unclear lane markings
# - More shadows and lighting variations

# Input/Output Settings
# ---------------------
input:
  # Path to the input image (required)
  image: "learning_projects/project-01-classical-lanes/data/input/007416_png.rf.95ed81938326ace32486b804613a7711.jpg"

output:
  # Path to save the output image (optional, set to null to skip saving)
  path: null
  # Whether to display the result in a window
  display: true

# Preprocessing Parameters
# ------------------------
preprocessing:
  # Higher blur for urban - reduce noise from surroundings
  # Urban scenes have more clutter (cars, signs, shadows)
  blur_kernel: 7

# Edge Detection Parameters
# -------------------------
edge_detection:
  # Higher thresholds for urban to reduce false positives
  # More noise in urban environments requires stricter edge detection
  canny_low: 60
  canny_high: 180

# Hough Transform Parameters
# --------------------------
hough_transform:
  # Distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid
  rho: 1

  # Angular resolution in radians (1 degree)
  theta: 0.017453293  # np.pi / 180

  # Higher threshold for urban - more strict to reduce noise
  # Need more votes to confirm a line is real
  threshold: 60

  # Shorter minimum line length for urban
  # City streets have shorter visible lane segments
  min_line_length: 30

  # Smaller gap tolerance for urban
  # Segments are shorter and more fragmented
  max_line_gap: 100

# Region of Interest (ROI) Settings
# ---------------------------------
roi:
  # Tighter ROI for urban to exclude more surrounding objects
  # Urban scenes have more distractions outside the immediate lane area
  vertices: null  # Use automatic ROI
  # For custom urban ROI, consider narrower trapezoid:
  # [[100, 720], [500, 400], [780, 400], [1180, 720]]

# Logging Settings
# ----------------
logging:
  # Set to DEBUG to see detailed processing information
  level: "INFO"
