# Lane Detection Configuration - Highway Scenario
# =================================================
# Optimized for highway driving conditions:
# - Well-marked lanes
# - Higher speeds (need longer line segments)
# - Less noise from surrounding objects
# - Wider field of view

# Input/Output Settings
# ---------------------
input:
  # Path to the input image (required)
  image: "learning_projects/project-01-classical-lanes/data/input/test.jpg"

output:
  # Path to save the output image (optional, set to null to skip saving)
  path: null
  # Whether to display the result in a window
  display: true

# Preprocessing Parameters
# ------------------------
preprocessing:
  # Lower blur for highway - preserve more detail
  # Highway lanes are usually clear and well-marked
  blur_kernel: 3

# Edge Detection Parameters
# -------------------------
edge_detection:
  # Lower thresholds for highway to catch all lane markings
  # Highway lanes are typically clearer, so we can be more selective
  canny_low: 40
  canny_high: 120

# Hough Transform Parameters
# --------------------------
hough_transform:
  # Distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid
  rho: 1

  # Angular resolution in radians (1 degree)
  theta: 0.017453293  # np.pi / 180

  # Lower threshold for highway - more tolerant
  # Highway lanes are continuous and well-marked
  threshold: 40

  # Longer minimum line length for highway
  # High-speed roads have longer, straighter lane segments
  min_line_length: 80

  # Larger gap tolerance for highway
  # Allow for dashed lines with bigger gaps
  max_line_gap: 200

# Region of Interest (ROI) Settings
# ---------------------------------
roi:
  # Wider ROI for highway to capture distant lane markers
  # Highway perspective shows lanes converging to a distant vanishing point
  vertices: null  # Use automatic ROI

# Logging Settings
# ----------------
logging:
  # Set to DEBUG to see detailed processing information
  level: "INFO"
