# Lane Detection Configuration File
# ===================================
# This file contains all configurable parameters for the classical lane detection pipeline

# Input/Output Settings
# ---------------------
input:
  # Path to the input image (required)
  image: "/home/vigoroth/mst_research/temporal 3D detection  BEV/learning_projects/project-01-classical-lanes/data/input/test.jpg"

output:
  # Path to save the output image (optional, set to null to skip saving)
  path: null
  # Whether to display the result in a window
  display: true

# Preprocessing Parameters
# ------------------------
preprocessing:
  # Kernel size for Gaussian blur (must be odd number)
  # Larger values = more blur, removes more noise but may lose edge detail
  # Recommended range: 3-9
  blur_kernel: 1

# Edge Detection Parameters
# -------------------------
edge_detection:
  # Low threshold for Canny edge detection
  # Edges with gradient below this are discarded
  # Recommended range: 30-80
  canny_low: 50

  # High threshold for Canny edge detection
  # Edges with gradient above this are definitely edges
  # Recommended range: 100-200
  canny_high: 150

# Hough Transform Parameters
# --------------------------
hough_transform:
  # Distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid
  # Smaller values = finer resolution but more computation
  rho: 1

  # Angular resolution in radians of the Hough grid
  # π/180 = 1 degree resolution
  theta: 0.017453293  # np.pi / 180

  # Minimum number of votes (intersections in Hough grid cell) for line detection
  # Higher values = more strict, fewer false positives but may miss real lines
  # Recommended range: 30-80
  threshold: 50

  # Minimum length of a line segment in pixels
  # Shorter segments are discarded
  # Recommended range: 30-80
  min_line_length: 30

  # Maximum allowed gap in pixels between segments to treat them as a single line
  # Larger values = more forgiving, connects more segments
  # Recommended range: 50-200
  max_line_gap: 50

# Region of Interest (ROI) Settings
# ---------------------------------
roi:
  # Custom ROI vertices as a list of [x, y] coordinates
  # Define a polygon (typically trapezoid) to mask the lane region
  # Set to null to use automatic ROI (default trapezoid based on image size)
  # Example: [[100, 720], [550, 450], [750, 450], [1180, 720]]
  vertices: null

# Logging Settings
# ----------------
logging:
  # Logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  # DEBUG: Detailed information for diagnosing problems
  # INFO: General informational messages about pipeline progress
  # WARNING: Warning messages about potential issues
  # ERROR: Error messages for serious problems
  level: "INFO"
